# Enhancing Malicious URL Detection: A Novel Framework Leveraging Priority Coefficient and Feature Evaluation
The title of paper is : Enhancing Malicious URL Detection: A Novel Framework Leveraging Priority Coefficient and Feature Evaluation. 

The dataset I and II and codes are uploded here. 
The proposed malicious URL detection framework utilizes a training dataset that includes **6000 samples**. In this research, this dataset is called dataset I. The 2000 malicious URLs were collected from a malicious URL dataset in Kaggle that was collected from 2020 to 2022, and 4000 benign samples were collected from the top 4000 site links of Alexa in 2022.

The experimental dataset contains **5000 real-time URLs** that were gathered recently and contains 2500 benign and 2500 malicious URLs (1500 phishing and 1000 malware). The malicious URLs were collected from two of the most well-known malware and phishing databases, URLhaus and PhishTank. In this research, this dataset is called dataset II and located in GitHub account. Each URL in the dataset is labelled as malicious or benign.
